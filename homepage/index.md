About me
--------

I have graduated from Stanford, but I have this webspace and the associated e-mail address for life.

As of August 2011, I'm a student in Berkeley's [Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science](http://logic.berkeley.edu).

From July 2009 to July 2011, I was at [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com). I'm still involved there.

My permanent e-mail address is some combination of the following strings: "cs.stanford.edu", "@", "slingamn".

I have several other e-mail addresses as well. If you're using an address at gmail.com, berkeley.edu, or math.berkeley.edu, don't worry; they all forward to the same place. However, my address at stanford.edu (without the "cs") has expired and shouldn't be used.

This URL (<https://cs.stanford.edu/people/slingamn/>) will probably eventually become my OpenID.

The GPG public key for the abovementioned permanent e-mail address is [here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/slingamn/publickey.txt).

I also have a [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/slingamn).

Work
----

I've written a term paper for a spring 2012 philosophy seminar, discussing a recent exchange between Adam Elga and Julian Jonker. It's called [Against the possibility of a formal account of rationality](philosophy/against_rationality/against_rationality.pdf).

Here's the one public piece of code I've worked on that I'm not excessively embarrassed by: a fast templating language for Python called [EZIO](http://github.com/Yelp/ezio/).

Teaching
--------

My teaching website is [here](http://math.berkeley.edu/~slingamn/).

I've written a couple of teaching handouts that may be of interest, since I intended them to fill perceived gaps in existing materials:

* [Debugging Tactics](36-debugging-tactics.pdf). This was written for Stanford's CS 106A course (introductory programming in Java). It aims to teach exceptions and "printline debugging" to people (like me) who are confused by interactive debuggers.
* [Some notes on limits](limits.pdf). This was written for Berkeley's Math 1A course (single-variable calculus). It's inspired by formal logic: it tries to clarify the definition of limit by explicitly comparing it with its negation, then relates it to the formulation of the definition as an adversary game.
